		<p><u>How did you get involed in this project?</u></p>
		 
		<p>It started as a simple idea from the people in the media deprtment. "Hey, would it be cool 
		 if we can tell children to buy more Pokémon merch?" The people in the merch department really 
		 liked that idea, and ran with it. I was worked media deprtment, so I was roped into this mess by defult.</p>
		 
		 <p><u>You didn't have a problem with this?</u></p>
		 
		 <p>Well.... No. We experimented on a small scale at first. Gamefreak promoted free company tours to children and 
		 their families. Children were separated from the families to preview the "newest" Pokémon episode. The experiments 
		 were 2-4 mintues in length, with the flashing only taking 3 seconds of the episode. Most were find, and others felt 
		 slightly nauseous. They would leave with new Pokémon plushes in hand for thanks.</p>
		 
		<p><u>What went wrong?</u></p>
		
		<p>In the end, of course I do. Unexpeting children weren't supposed to be involed in this corporate mistake,</p>
