		<h3>The Banned Pokémon Episode 38</h3>
		<p>"Dennō Senshi Porygon" translated as "Computer Warrior Porygon", although more commonly "Electric Soldier Porygon", 
		is the 38th episode of the Pokémon anime's first season. Its sole broadcast was in Japan on December 16, 1997.</p>
		
		<p>In the episode, Ash and his friends find that there is something wrong with the Poké Ball transmitting device
		at the local Pokémon Center. To find out what is wrong, they must go inside the machine.</p>
		
		<p>The episode became infamous for a scene featuring repetitive visual effects that induced photosensitive epileptic 
		seizures in a substantial number of Japanese viewers, with more than 600 children across Japan taken to hospitals. 
		The incident is referred to in Japan as the "Pokémon Shock".</p>

		<h3>Lavender Town Syndrome</h3>
		<p>Lavender Town is a fictional village in the 1996 video games Pokémon Red and Blue. Stylized as a haunted location, 
		Lavender Town is home to the Pokémon Tower, a burial ground for deceased Pokémon and a location to find Ghost-Type Pokémon.</p>
		
		<p>The background music of Lavender Town is renowned for adding to the town's creepy atmosphere and in the 2010s, it gave rise 
		to the "Lavender Town Syndrome" creepypasta, a fictional story about hundreds of Japanese children dying by suicide after listening 
		to the track from high pitched tones that only they could hear.</p>

		<h3>Why Did This Happened</h3>
		<p>Pokémon seems to be notorious for having visual and sound effects that harm children, if on mistake. But what if they weren't on mistake? 
		Leaked information from a former Gamefreak employee, and member of what is known as "Project Dream Eater" was released.Childrens’ minds aren’t 
		fully developed and can be molded by the simplest ideas. The fictitious organization that is presenting this material is the marketing team at 
		Gamefreak. They are trying to sell more useless and crap merch to children. So, they have been experimenting with sound frequency and visual cues t
		o try to trick children into begging for more Pokémon merch. But as you can see, both methods have failed. After Episode 38 of the Pokémon anime, 
		they scraped the idea. This project ultimatelt failed in the end, and all proof of these experiments were eased. Untill now...</p>
