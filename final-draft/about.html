		<h3>What was "Project Dream Eater"</h3>
		<p> Project Dream Eater were shady 
		experiments in the realm of entertainment 
		and media, at the Pokémon Company. 
		Founded under mysterious circumstances, Dream Eater has 
		swiftly risen to power, wielding its influence 
		over unsuspecting audiences, particularly 
		targeting children, through the guise of beloved Pokémon media.</p>
		
		<p>Project Dream Eater deprives from the Pokémon move "Dream Eater".
		The user of the move eats the dreams of the terget, leaving them with 
		less health then before.</p>
		
		<p>They experimented with sounds and flashing colors to try to control children into buying more Pokémon merch.</p>
	
		<h3>Their Slogan</h3>
		<p class="slog">"At Project Dream Eater, our mission 
		is simple: to control the minds of the masses 
		through manipulation disguised as entertainment. 
		We exploit the innocence of children, using their 
		love for Pokémon to ensnare their minds and bend 
		them to our will."</p>
		
		<h3>The Development of Mind Conrol Using Light</h3>

		<p>Director C. Justin Lee at the Center for Cognition and 
		Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and 
		professor Heo Won Do at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science 
		and Technology (KAIST) led the study, and their findings were 
		later published in the scientific journal Neuron, further outlining 
		the components and processes behind the Opto-vTrap.</p>

		<p>The research team tested the technique on mice in a lab setting 
		and discovered that the system's blue light was capable of temporarily 
		controlling the release of neurotransmitters. The light triggered vesicle 
		clusterization in the brain, which declustered when the light was turned 
		off again, with neurons regaining their full functions within an hour.</p>

		<p>The authors of the study underscored the importance of studying brain 
		cell types in order to better understand brain functions. They considered 
		the real-world benefits of a technology like Opto-vTrap and how it could 
		be used in various fields of brain science research to potentially contribute 
		to the treatment of certain neurological disorders in the future.</p>
		
		<p>These techniqes were used in Episode 38 of the Pokémon anime.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>The Subliminal Sonic Influence: How Sound Cues Can Manipulate Juvenile Minds</h3>
		<p>This reserch was recived from the leak. This report tells how flashing colors where used in mind control,</p>

		<h3>The Negatives</h3>
		<p>In clinical settings, flashing images 
		have shown promise as a therapeutic tool 
		for treating conditions such as post-traumatic 
		stress disorder (PTSD) and addiction. By leveraging 
		the brain's capacity for neuroplasticity, 
		clinicians can use controlled exposure to flashing 
		images to rewire maladaptive neural circuits 
		and promote healthier patterns of thought and behavior.</p>
		
		<p>However, the use of flashing images and rhythmic sounds also raises 
		ethical concerns regarding consent and autonomy. 
		In contexts where individuals may be unaware or 
		unable to consent to exposure, such as public spaces 
		or online platforms, the potential for exploitation 
		and harm is heightened. Moreover, the indiscriminate 
		use of flashing images can pose risks to individuals 
		with certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy, 
		where it may trigger seizures or other adverse reactions.
		Like suicidal thoughts.</p>
