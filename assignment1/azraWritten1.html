				The passage of The Age of App-quarius discusses several concerns that come with the dominance 
				of mobile apps, and its impact on the internet and web design. The article expresses frustration
				about the limited customization options for smartphone apps. "Because websites had to either become 
				apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to 
				become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform, and the results are, frankly, fucking boring." 
				Most websites I visit are on my phone, and from how a website looks and functions, I disagree with the 
				idea that most are boring. With the number of limited functions, a phone’s website gives web developers 
				the challenge to make something new and creative for users. The article also criticizes apps and app stores 
				for not being built on a universal open platform, leading to a lack of competition. I’ve only made one app 
				in my life, and it wasn’t easy. It being hard that the program being used was only on Apple computers. 
				I have Windows. So, I agree with that if universal open platform for making apps was an option, 
				there would be more unique apps out there.

				"Vaporwave, in the most general sense, is the often critical, ironic, or satirical appropriation of 80s 
				and 90s cultural symbols". In a sense, when I think of 80s-90s pop culture, Vaporwave always comes up. 
				While I listen to a ton of Vaporwave music, I don’t really know its origins. Vaporwave is a microgenre 
				of electronic music and a subgenre of hauntology, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged 
				in the early 2010s. The fusion of visual and musical elements in vaporwave provided a unique space for 
				artists to deconstruct and repurpose cultural symbols. The rapid assimilation of vaporwave visuals by 
				platforms like Tumblr and Instagram resulted in a dilution of its original intent. As the article explains, 
				the visual aspects of vaporwave, which were originally intended to convey nostalgia and critique, have been 
				widely consumed and co-opted by mainstream media. Vaporwave sheds light on the tension between expressions 
				and their assimilation into mainstream consumer culture. You wouldn’t think that such design and music would 
				play so much in Internet history.

				In “Revenge of the Old Internet”, the author seems to be commenting on the evolving aesthetics and cultural 
				dynamics of Facebook. Particularly focusing on the shift from a professional-class platform to one that is 
				increasingly cluttered and mocked. It highlights the contrast between Facebook and other platforms like Twitter, 
				Tumblr, and Reddit, where communities mock the seemingly outdated and politically noxious content circulated by 
				older individuals on Facebook. The vivid commentary on the cultural shifts within social media platforms, 
				using humor and irony to convey a sense of rebellion against the established norms of Facebook. My mother’s 
				first and only social media account is Facebook. I remember how much time she put in to make account that 
				shows off the happy and successful life she made for herself. Posting almost daily. Nowadays, she doesn’t 
				even go on it anymore. The only time she does is to just wish someone a happy birthday. Because of the reasons 
				of outdated and politically noxious content on Facebook, she checked out of the app. The only reason I have a 
				Facebook account is to play my Mata Quest 2.

				To go back to the simpler times of the old internet might sound dandy, but we have evolved to love the 
				creature comforts that today's internet provides today. But so much of what was loved about the old internet 
				is still impalmented into today’s internet. Be it the aesthetic, functionality, and its memeability.
