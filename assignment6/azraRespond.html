		<h1>Worst Real Housewives Series</h1>
	</header>

	<section id="author">
		<p> 
			The Real Housewives of Dubai followed a group of women truly living extravagant 
			lives. This series, which debuted in June 2022, showed off what it is like to be 
			incredibly wealthy. They don’t call Dubai the “City of Gold” for no reason. Every 
			event was over-the-top.This series featured former Ladies of London star Caroline
			Stanbury and breakout star Chanel Ayan. Cast member Nina Ali exited RHODubai before 
			the second season began filming.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			There was some backlash about Bravo’s decision to set a series in the Middle East 
			and many viewers were upset by the suppressive laws for the LGBTQ+ community and women. 
			Fans have only watched the first season, so hopefully Season 2 will be even more glamorous. 
			And dramatic.

		<p> 
			I grew up with a single mom who watched nothing but Real Housewives, Teen Mom,
			and Jersey Shore. Reality tv was my life from 3 to 10. I hate the Housewive shows, they all suck.
			Its rich bored housewives make drama from nothing. Except my girl Lisa Vanderpump, she is so nice
			and to good for everyone bullshit. 
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			But, in my opinion, the wrost Real Housewivesm series is Orange County. For one, it has Vicki Gunvalson.
			If you asked me the first person I every hated in my life, it her. She is the worst, but its her delusions, 
			whooping it up, and freak outs that makes her popular. Which makes Orange County popular too. She's not on the 
			show no more, but she still gets into dramas and controversy with other Housewives.
